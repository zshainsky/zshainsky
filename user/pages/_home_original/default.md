### About me
I am currently working as a Sales Engineer at [Splunk](www.splunk.com) in Dallas, TX. I studied at Southern Methodist University where I graduated with both a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and a Masters in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science. I am passionate about technology and am constantly curious picking up new hobbies. I have worked on all sorts of projects such as, full stack web development, mobile development, Arduino, sensor networks, search engines, Splunk apps, and FPV racing quadcopters to name a few.
